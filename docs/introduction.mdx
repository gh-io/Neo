# NeomindAI

**NeomindAI** is a modular artificial intelligence framework for autonomous systems, designed to bridge perception, learning, and real-world execution.

It combines:
- Neural networks for cognition
- Reinforcement learning for adaptation
- Real-time hardware control via microcontrollers

NeomindAI is built for robotics, embodied AI, and intelligent agents operating beyond simulation.
