# Sensors & Perception

NeomindAI supports heterogeneous sensor fusion.

## Supported Sensors

| Sensor | Purpose | Interface |
|------|--------|----------|
| RGB / Depth Camera | Vision & detection | OpenCV |
| LiDAR / Ultrasonic | Mapping & avoidance | ROS2 / SLAM |
| IMU | Orientation & balance | I2C / SPI |
| Tactile sensors | Collision detection | GPIO / ADC |

Sensor data is normalized and fed into the neural decision engine as structured state vectors.
